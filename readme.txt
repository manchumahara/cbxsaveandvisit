Adds a Save and Visit button to the admin post edit screen which allows you to return to the post listing page after editing. This plugin is based on another plugin 'Save and Close'.

== Description ==

Does what it says on the tin! 

So what is the plugin? The name says it all really, this just adds a Save and Visit button to all pages, posts and custom post types. We've done away with the click so no longer do you need to hit "Update" or "Publish" then click back your post/page on frontend. Save and Visit will just take you right back to your post details! Simples!


== Installation ==

1. Upload `cbxsaveandvisit` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. You'll now see an "Update and Visit" button when editing a post, or a "Publish and Visit" button when creating a post!
